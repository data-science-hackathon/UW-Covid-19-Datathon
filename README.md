# Summary

Our repository consists of 2 notebooks and a pdf. The notebooks show our prediction and time series forecasting for covid-19 cases and deaths in the US states, along with some Exploratory data analysis and interesting correlation findings. The pdf outlines visuals and  summarizes our methodology, workflow, and findings.

# Goal

We wanted to predict how the trajectory of covid would be over the next 30 days. So, we trained an ensemble time series model to do so.

# Data 
The data we used is labelled as us-states.csv in our repository. It was obtained from the following Github repository: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv
