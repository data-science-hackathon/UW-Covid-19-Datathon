# UW-Covid-19-Datathon

Our repository consists of 2 notebooks and a pdf. The notebooks show our prediction and time series forecasting for covid-19 cases and deaths in the US states, along with some Exploratory data analysis and interesting correlation findings. The pdf outlines visuals and  summarizes our methodology, workflow, and findings.
