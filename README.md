# Summary

Our repository consists of 2 notebooks and a pdf. The notebooks show our prediction and time series forecasting for covid-19 cases and deaths in the US states, along with some Exploratory data analysis and interesting correlation findings. The pdf has a much more detailed outline of visualizations and summarizes our methodology, workflow, and results, as well as a forecast of the covid deaths trajectory for the next 30 days. 

# Goal

We wanted to predict how the trajectory of covid deaths would be over the next 30 days. So, we trained an ensemble time series model with an LSTM and ARIMA to do so.

# Data 
The data we used is labelled as us-states.csv in our repository. It was obtained from the following Github repository: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-states.csv
